# Energy-Consumption-ANN
Predicting global energy consumption using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with TensorFlow and Keras.
This model achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 2410.10 TWh and uses Batch Normalization and Dropout to optimize performance
Project Results
Model: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Final MAE: 2410.10 TWh

Key Techniques: Batch Normalization, Dropout (0.2-0.4), and Early Stopping

Analysis: The model successfully captured global energy trends, though loss curves indicate slight overfitting which was managed using regularization.
